[[!meta title="MIT SIPB Web Script Service"]]
The web script service allows individuals and groups to put CGI scripts
(Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scheme, etc) on the web using nothing more
than an [Athena](http://web.mit.edu/ist/topics/athena/) account.
Although this service has been designed with reliability in mind, it
should not be used to run critical applications that cannot tolerate
downtime.

Your scripts will automatically be accessible at URLs starting with
http://lockername.**scripts**.mit.edu/.

If, at some point, your group would like to make some-name.mit.edu point
to your scripts.mit.edu website, you can request such a hostname using
our [hostname management interface](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/14).

#### **To sign up for the service:**

If you just want to get started with a pre-made application, consider
trying our [Quick Start installers](../start/) instead. Otherwise, you
can sign up for the service by logging into an Athena workstation and
running:

athena% add scripts\
 athena% signup-web\

The command will ask you whether you would like to sign up your own
account, or a locker that you control.

(If you are confused about how to run the above commands on Athena,
e-mail scripts@mit.edu for assistance. You must have an [Athena
account](http://web.mit.edu/olh/Register/) and understand the [MITnet
rules of use](http://web.mit.edu/olh/Welcome/rules.html) in order to use
the service. You should also understand that if you install software
from the web in your account, you are responsible for keeping that
software up-to-date so that it is secure.)

This signup process will create a **web\_scripts** directory. You may
now put scripts in this directory and have them served to the web. Your
scripts’ filenames must end in one of the following file extensions:
.pl, .php, .py, or .cgi

Files whose name end with “.php” will be executed with the PHP
interpreter. Otherwise, each file must be marked executable (chmod +x
filename.py) and have a [shebang
line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) corresponding to
its interpreter. This should be the first line of the file. You can
determine the path of an interpreter by [ssh-ing to the scripts
server](/faq/41). You are most likely to want one of:

-   \#!/usr/bin/perl
-   \#!/usr/bin/python
-   \#!/usr/bin/php-cgi

Finally, add yourself to the [scripts-announce mailing
list](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/scripts-announce) if you
would like to receive announcements of major service changes and
outages. This list receives less than one e-mail per month on average.

Questions](../faq/).

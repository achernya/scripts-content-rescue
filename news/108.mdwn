[[!meta title="scripts.mit.edu Fedora 11 Transition"]]
On Thursday, July 9, 2009, all of the
[scripts.mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu/) servers will be upgraded from
[Fedora 9](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/9) to [Fedora
11](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/11), which was released on
June 9. We strongly encourage you to [test your
website](/upgrade#testing) as soon as possible, and to contact us at
[scripts@mit.edu](mailto:scripts@mit.edu) or come to our [office
hours](/upgrade#hours) in W20-557 if you experience any problems. The
easiest way to test your site is to run the following commands at an
Athena workstation and then visit your website in the browser that
opens, but [see this page](/upgrade) for more details and important
information: \

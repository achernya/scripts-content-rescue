[[!meta title="Django on scripts.mit.edu updated to 1.0 and made default"]]
We’ve updated the Django Python package on scripts to the \
 recently-released 1.0 final version, as part of a standard Fedora
package \
 update. We will be releasing an auto-installer soon, although you can \
 manually set up Django with the django-admin.py command and the sample
\
 FastCGI wrapper on the Django web site.

If you’re currently using a Django 0.96 site, you can keep Django sites
in \
 your locker at version 0.96 by adding the following lines to the top of
\
 your FastCGI wrapper and manage.py, before any import statements
referencing “django”:

    __requires__='Django<1.0'
    import pkg_resources
    pkg_resources.require('Django<1.0')

* * * * *

If this does not work for you, you can try running the following Athena
commands, where LOCKER is the locker with an old Django install:

    attach LOCKER
    mkdir -p /mit/LOCKER/lib/python2.5/site-packages
    cd /mit/LOCKER/lib/python2.5/site-packages
    fs sa . daemon.scripts read
    echo 'import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Django-0.96_None-py2.5.egg")' > 00django-path.pth

This will make the Django 0.96 package take precedence for all sites in
your locker. You can delete the 00django-path.pth file when you’re ready
to upgrade to 1.0.

We will keep Django 0.96 available until at least the end of fall term.

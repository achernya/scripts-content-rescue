[[!meta title="SSLUserName being disabled"]]
On March 28, 2008, the scripts.mit.edu team will disable the default
`SSLUserName` functionality. The result will be that, with no other
configuration, your scripts will no longer receive the user’s e-mail
address in the `REMOTE_USER` environment variable. If you wish to
recreate the old functionality, you can create a .htaccess file in your
script’s directory containing “SSLUserName SSL\_CLIENT\_S\_DN\_Email”.
However, we recommend that you use the SSLCert authentication module as
described in [our FAQ](/faq/15).

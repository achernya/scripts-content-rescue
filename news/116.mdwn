[[!meta title="WordPress autoinstaller upgraded to version 2.8.3"]]
Weâ€™ve upgraded the [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) autoinstaller on
scripts.mit.edu to install WordPress version 2.8.3. This is the most
current stable version of WordPress, and includes a security fix that
was missed in version 2.8.2, which was just recently released.

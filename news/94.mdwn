[[!meta title="PLT Scheme (mzscheme) command line changed"]]
As part of a standard system upgrade, we upgraded PLT Scheme to a newer
version that seems to have different command line options. In
particular, if you were using the syntax

**mzscheme -L plt-pretty-big-text.ss lang**

to enable the “Pretty Big” language, you now need to say

**mzscheme -l lang/plt-pretty-big-text.ss**

(note the change from capital to lowercase L). In addition, to get a
REPL, you’ll need to say **-i** with this option. Some other options
have also been removed; run **mzscheme —help** to see what is available.

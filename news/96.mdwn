[[!meta title="Trac autoinstalls updated"]]
Weâ€™ve performed an update of [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org)
[autoinstalls](http://scripts.mit.edu/start) for all users who accept
[Scripts security updates](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/44). This update
corrects a data confidentiality bug caused by a typo which was
discovered by a member of the Scripts Team. The specific problem was a
malformed `.htaccess` file in the `tracdata` directory. This file is in
place to prevent people from viewing configuration and other private
data over the web.

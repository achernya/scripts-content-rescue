[[!meta title="Cron issues (resolved)"]]
We’re aware of reports that some cron scripts are failing with “No such
file or directory” errors in **getcwd**. We’re investigating the problem
and trying to determine the cause, and we’ll post an update when it has
been resolved.

There are also issues of files in AFS not appearing updated on scripts
after being changed on other servers. We’re also looking into the issue.
If you run into this, let us know at scripts@mit.edu and we’ll see what
we can do.

**Updated (08/25):** The problem has been resolved, and cron scripts
should be working correctly. Working with the OpenAFS maintainers, we
have identified this as a bug in OpenAFS and have reported it upstream.

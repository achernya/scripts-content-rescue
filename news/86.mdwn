[[!meta title="Announcement: server upgrade and URL changes"]]
We have just completed an upgrade to Fedora 9 from Fedora 7; this brings
us in line with the latest feature, stability, and security upgrades to
the software installed on the scripts.mit.edu servers. Most software did
transfer, but some was unavailable in the Fedora 9 repository.

For example, we do not have Python 2.4 installed because it is not in
the Fedora repository, and we haven’t installed the compat-python24
package from a third-party repository since we believe it is not used
(in favor of Python 2.5). If you would like us to install Python 2.4, or
any packages that are not currently installed, please e-mail
[scripts@mit.edu](mailto:scripts@mit.edu).

We also recently announced a planned URL change from the form\
 **http://scripts.mit.edu/\~geofft/detect.php**\
 to\
 **http://geofft.scripts.mit.edu/detect.php**\
 The new URLs are cleaner and provide improved security isolation
(cookies, etc.) between sites. Don’t worry; the old URLs will continue
to work until the end of fall term, and even then we will redirect them
to the new URLs.

More information is available in [the full
announcement](http://web.mit.edu/geofft/Public/scripts-announcement-20080807)
.

We are planning an autoupgrade in the fall (well in advance of the
cutoff) to provide support for the new URL style for scripts.mit.edu
sites from the [autoinstallers](/start/).

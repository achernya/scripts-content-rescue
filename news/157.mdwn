[[!meta title="sql.mit.edu default storage engine changed from MyISAM to InnoDB"]]
We have changed the MySQL [default storage
engine](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/storage-engine-setting.html)
on sql.mit.edu from
[MyISAM](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/myisam-storage-engine.html)
to
[InnoDB](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-storage-engine.html).
This change only affects newly created tables. Existing tables are
unaffected, with the exception noted below of Trac databases. No user
action is required.

InnoDB offers many improvements over MyISAM and has become the default
engine upstream as of MySQL 5.5. Even though sql.mit.edu still runs
MySQL 5.1, we made this change because it is [required by Trac
1.0.2](http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/10993). We have also converted
all Trac databases to InnoDB to let them continue working with Trac
1.0.2.

If you wish to take advantage of the new features provided by InnoDB,
you can [convert existing
tables](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/converting-tables-to-innodb.html)
using the [ALTER
TABLE](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/alter-table.html) command.
You can still create new MyISAM tables by passing the ENGINE=MyISAM
parameter to [CREATE
TABLE](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-table.html). You
can also convert InnoDB tables back to MyISAM with ALTER TABLE.

Note that the version of InnoDB running on sql.mit.edu does not yet
support [FULLTEXT
indexes](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/fulltext-search.html).
We expect this to be eventually fixed when we upgrade to MySQL 5.6 or
later. Until then, tables that use FULLTEXT indexes should be left on
the MyISAM engine.

[[!meta title="*.scripts.mit.edu certificate signed by Equifax"]]
We’re glad to let you know that we’ve purchased an SSL/HTTPS certificate
for \*.scripts.mit.edu domain names that’s signed by a well-known
signatory, Equifax, instead of by the MIT Certificate Authority. This
means that you can use HTTPS URLs for those domain names in any popular
browser without having to download and trust the MIT CA in advance —
great news for those of you running websites that target people outside
the MIT community. MIT client certificates continue to work as normal.

We’ll also be installing an Equifax-signed certificate for
https://scripts.mit.edu/ soon, but we continue to encourage the use of
\*.scripts.mit.edu names instead of scripts.mit.edu/\~ names for their
improved security properties.

For those of you with \*.mit.edu names, you can continue to use or
request MIT-signed certificates as always, or you can have the secure
parts of your site use a \*.scripts.mit.edu URL or discuss other
arrangements with us.

[[!meta title="Upgrade to Fedora 9"]]
scripts.mit.edu has temporarily added a Fedora 9 server to the server
pool, in preparation for a full upgrade to Fedora 9 this summer. The
server is otherwise configured identically to the existing servers, so
all your scripts should continue to run. If you notice any problems with
your scripts, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at
[scripts@mit.edu](mailto:scripts@mit.edu).

[[!meta title="Ruby on Rails autoinstaller"]]
At long last, weâ€™ve just deployed a brand new
[autoinstaller](http://scripts.mit.edu/start/) for [Ruby on
Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), the popular
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) based web application framework.

Ruby on Rails has been supported on
[scripts.mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu/) for quite some time, but the
setup process was entirely manual, and involved many nonintuitive steps.
You can now get a working Rails installation up and running for your own
application in less than 60 seconds by typing

    $ add scripts
    $ scripts-rails

from any Athena machine, and following the instructions.

This brings the count of autoinstallable applications up to 12:

    advancedbook
    django
    e107
    gallery2
    joomla
    mediawiki
    phpbb
    phpical
    rails
    trac
    turbogears
    wordpress

You can read more about these applications on our [quick-start
page](http://scripts.mit.edu/start/).

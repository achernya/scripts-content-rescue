[[!meta title="Trac autoinstaller"]]
We’ve just added another [autoinstaller](http://scripts.mit.edu/start/)
to our stable: [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/), the issue tracker
everyone seems to use these days for software projects.

You can get a Trac instance up and running for your own project in less
than 60 seconds by typing

    $ add scripts
    $ scripts-trac

from any Athena machine, and following the instructions.

Like all autoinstalled software, Trac instances will be [automatically
upgraded](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/44) after the Trac upstream makes a
new release. (*[see update below]* You can [turn this feature
off](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/44) if you want, and keep up with
security upgrades on your own.)

This brings the count of autoinstallable applications up to 9:

    advancedbook
    e107
    gallery2
    joomla
    mediawiki
    phpbb
    phpical
    trac
    wordpress

You can read more about these applications on our [quick-start
page](http://scripts.mit.edu/start/).

**update**: In fact, because of the way Trac works, you can’t turn off
autoupgrades in an autoinstalled Trac instance — there’s one central
copy of the software on scripts.mit.edu, not a copy in each Trac
instance. You can always do a manual install of the software if you
really want to handle upgrades yourself.

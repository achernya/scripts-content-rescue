[[!meta title="scripts.mit.edu Fedora 20 transition"]]
On Wednesday, August 27th, 2014, all of the
[scripts.mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu/) servers will be upgraded from
[Fedora 17](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/17) to [Fedora
20](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/20), which was released on
December 17. We strongly encourage you to [test your
website](/upgrade/155#f20-testing) as soon as possible, and to contact
us at [scripts@mit.edu](mailto:scripts@mit.edu) or come to our office in
W20-557 if you experience any problems. The easiest way to test your
site is to run the following commands at an Athena workstation and then
visit your website in the browser that opens, but [see this
page](/upgrade/155) for more details and important information: \

[[!meta title="MS Office XML and OpenOffice.org file types added to white list"]]
Our [whitelist of file types served directly to the web](/faq/50/) has
for a long time included .doc, .xls, and .ppt. With the advent of new
XML-based Microsoft Office formats, and with the popularity of
LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org, there have been requests for
whitelisting these additional file types. As of yesterday, the new
Office XML filetypes — .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc. — as well as ODF file
types — .odt, .ods, .odp, etc. — will also be served directly to the
web.

In addition to files you place in your locker, this also affects files
uploaded to your website via the standard upload feature of apps such as
MediaWiki and WordPress.

The full list of whitelisted extensions is posted [in our
FAQ](/faq/50/).

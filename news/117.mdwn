[[!meta title="WordPress autoinstaller upgraded to version 2.8.4"]]
Weâ€™ve upgraded the [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) autoinstaller on
scripts.mit.edu to install WordPress version 2.8.4. This is the most
current stable version of WordPress, and includes yet another important
security fix for an issue that was present through version 2.8.3, which
was just recently released.

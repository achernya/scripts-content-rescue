[[!meta title="New Hostname Management Inteface"]]
The scripts.mit.edu team is pleased to announce [a new online interface
for managing your scripts.mit.edu
hostnames](http://pony.scripts.mit.edu) (lovingly called Pony). You can
now easily request short URLs to use with your scripts.mit.edu sites and
reconfigure your existing hostnames.

On Tuesday, January 8th, 2014, all of the
[scripts.mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu/) servers will be upgraded from
[Fedora 17](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/17) to [Fedora
19](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/19/Schedule), which was
released on July 2. We strongly encourage you to [test your
website](/upgrade/154#f19-testing) as soon as possible, and to contact
us at [scripts@mit.edu](mailto:scripts@mit.edu) or come to our office in

site is to run the following commands at an Athena workstation and then
visit your website in the browser that opens:\
\
` athena% add scripts`\
 `athena% firefox-test `

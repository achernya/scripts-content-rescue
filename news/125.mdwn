[[!meta title="Certificate Authentication in Safari"]]
If you’ve tried to use our [recommended configuration](/faq/15) for
authenticating users using MIT certificates, you’ve probably discovered
that Safari users are not offered the opportunity to select a
certificate. This is due to a bug in Safari’s SSL implementation where
it will never present a certificate unless the server requires that it
present one (we do not require that a certificate be presented, so that
we can show a page saying “you need certificates”).

Starting today, we’ve added some additional code that will force Safari
to show the certificate selection dialog. If you are using the
recommended configuration for certificate authentication, this will take
effect for your site automatically. (Specifically, what we now do is
that force an SSL renegotation if we find the Safari browser.)

If you are using any other configuration than our recommended
configuration, the behavior should not change.

(You can see the [technical details of this
change](/trac/changeset/1483) in our source browser.)

[[!meta title=".htaccess files no longer require mode 777"]]
It is no longer necessary to use `chmod 777 .htaccess` to mark your
.htaccess files readable by Apache. As of May 30, 2009, Apache is now
given implicit read access to all file with names beginning in “.ht”,
such as .htaccess or .htpasswd (assuming the AFS directory is readable
by daemon.scripts, as is automatically the case in your web\_scripts
directory by default).

[[!meta title="scripts.mit.edu Fedora 15 Transition"]]
On Monday, November 21, 2011, all of the
[scripts.mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu/) servers will be upgraded from
[Fedora 13](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/13) to [Fedora
15](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/15), which was released on
May 25. We strongly encourage you to [test your
website](/upgrade#f15-testing) as soon as possible, and to contact us at
[scripts@mit.edu](mailto:scripts@mit.edu) or come to our office in
W20-557 if you experience any problems. The easiest way to test your
site is to run the following commands at an Athena workstation and then
visit your website in the browser that opens, but [see this
page](/upgrade) for more details and important information: \

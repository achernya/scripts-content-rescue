[[!meta title="Problems with some scripts sites over the weekend"]]
Over the weekend we had some issues with content for scripts.mit.edu
virtual hosts/CNAMEs (\*.mit.edu sites, only not \*.scripts.mit.edu
sites) that had not requested a SSL server certificate assigned to them.
The issue mostly affected these sites when accessed over SSL on port
444.

First, for a couple of minutes on Friday night, I made a change to one
of our web servers that accidentally caused requests to all such sites
to receive the content for axo.mit.edu (the alphabetically first vhost
with its own certificate). That change did not reach the other server,
and the misdirection was fixed as soon as I realized my mistake.

However, this only fixed http and https, and did not take effect for
port :444. This was corrected earlier today after one of our users
reported it while testing a site that he had requested an SSL
certificate for.

I sincerely apologize for any trouble this may have caused. Hopefully
this did not affect many sites, because those intending to use SSL
should have a certificate, and sites with certificates installed were
not affected.

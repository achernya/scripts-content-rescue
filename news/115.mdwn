[[!meta title="Django autoinstalls now see updates to your code instantly!"]]
The [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)
[autoinstaller](http://scripts.mit.edu/start/) has, up until now, told
you that when you update your code files, you need to `touch index.fcgi`
in order for the changes to be reflected on the web. Unfortunately, that
feature has never worked on [scripts.mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu/).
We’ve finally identified the reason for this issue, and implemented an
improvement to the autoinstaller — it is no longer necessary to kill
your `python` processes or `touch` your `index.fcgi` files. Updates to
your `.py` files are now reflected immediately on the web without you
having to do anything else.

We have applied this enhancement to all existing Django autoinstalls
that accept [our automatic updates](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/44).

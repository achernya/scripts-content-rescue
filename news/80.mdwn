[[!meta title="Update to WordPress 2.3.3"]]
We’ve just updated our [autoinstaller](http://scripts.mit.edu/start/)
for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) to 2.3.3, which includes a
security update.

You can install WordPress via:

    $ add scripts
    $ scripts-wordpress

from any Athena machine, and following the instructions.

By default, we automatically update your installations to keep up with
security updates. We’ve updated all 2.3.2 installations to 2.3.3 for
those who haven’t disabled upgrades. (You can [turn off
autoupgrading](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/44) if you want, and keep up
with security upgrades on your own.)

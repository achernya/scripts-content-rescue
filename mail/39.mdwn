[[!meta title="MIT SIPB Mail Script Service"]]
The mail script service uses
[procmail](http://www.google.com/search?q=procmail) allows people to set
up scripts to process e-mail using an
[Athena](http://web.mit.edu/ist/topics/athena/) account. The mail script
service is designed and maintained with less of a focus on reliability
than the web script service, and should not be used to run applications
that cannot tolerate downtime or occasional lost messages.

Your mail scripts will automatically process mail sent to

    YOUR_LOCKER_NAME@scripts.mit.edu or
    YOUR_LOCKER_NAME+ANY_TAG@scripts.mit.edu or
    ANY_TAG@YOUR_LOCKER_NAME.scripts.mit.edu

If you have a non-MIT hostname served by scripts.mit.edu, your mail
scripts will also process mail sent to

    ANY_TAG@YOUR_DOMAIN.com

You can access the tag on a message from your procmailrc file by parsing
the X-Original-To header or as the \$1 variable.

#### **To sign up for the service:**

    athena% add scripts
    athena% signup-mail

(If you are confused about how to run the above commands on Athena,
e-mail scripts@mit.edu for assistance. You must have an [Athena
account](http://web.mit.edu/olh/Register/) and understand the [MITnet
rules of use](http://web.mit.edu/olh/Welcome/rules.html) in order to use
the service.)

This signup process will create a **mail\_scripts** directory. Learn
about [procmail](http://www.google.com/search?q=procmail) and modify
your \~/mail\_scripts/procmailrc file to do whatever mail processing you
desire. You may want to look at our sample files in
[/mit/jbarnold/mail\_scripts](http://web.mit.edu/jbarnold/mail_scripts/).
If your scripts need to write data, be sure to [give daemon.scripts the
necessary
access](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/31/can-my-scripts-write-data-somewhere)
in AFS.

Finally, add yourself to the [scripts-announce mailing
list](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/scripts-announce) if you
would like to receive announcements of major service changes and
outages. This list receives less than one e-mail per month on average.

Questions](../faq/).

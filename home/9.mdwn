**scripts.mit.edu** is a hosting service for the MIT community that
provides several popular web packages such as **MediaWiki** and
**WordPress**, as well as **CGI script**, **MySQL**, **cron**, and
**procmail** hosting. The service is **free to any Athena account
holder** or group locker. It has over 3000 registered user accounts, and
is used by a number of student organizations and academic groups at MIT.

Processing Board](http://sipb.mit.edu/) (SIPB), MITâ€™s volunteer student
group dedicated to computing. It is neither run nor supported by
[IS&T](http://ist.mit.edu/), and we make no guarantees about [uptime or
support](/faq/136/what-level-of-support-does-scriptsmitedu-provide).

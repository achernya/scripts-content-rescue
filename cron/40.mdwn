[[!meta title="MIT SIPB Scheduled Jobs Service (Cron)"]]
The scheduled jobs service uses
[cron](http://www.google.com/search?q=cron) to allow people to set up
scripts to run at certain times. Although this service has been designed
with reliability in mind, it should not be used to run critical
applications that cannot tolerate downtime.

#### **To sign up for the service:**

athena% add scripts\
 athena% signup-cron\

(If you are confused about how to run the above commands on Athena,
e-mail scripts@mit.edu for assistance. You must have an [Athena
account](http://web.mit.edu/olh/Register/) and understand the [MITnet
rules of use](http://web.mit.edu/olh/Welcome/rules.html) in order to use
the service.)

This signup process will create a **cron\_scripts** directory and place
a sample crontab file in it. This provided crontab contains some
information that should help you get started. Changes to your crontab
will never take effect until you explicitly load your crontab. You can
do so by changing to the `cron_scripts` directory and running
`cronload crontab` (if you do so from Athena, make sure you have
previously run `add scripts` in your login shell).

Finally, add yourself to the [scripts-announce mailing
list](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/scripts-announce) if you
would like to receive announcements of major service changes and
outages. This list receives less than one e-mail per month on average.

Questions](../faq/).

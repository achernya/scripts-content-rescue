[[!meta title="Why do my mail scripts not generate bounces?"]]
The scripts server interprets procmail failures as temporary failures,
queueing the mail until the procmailrc is fixed. This is useful if your
procmailrc is unreadable or broken, but it can make debugging difficult.
If you want to explicitly bounce a message, you can use a stanza similar
to this in your procmailrc file:

    :0:
    * ^Delivered-To:.*USER_NAME\+TAG@.*
    {
            EXITCODE=67
            HOST
    }

The list of recognized exit codes can be found in the [sysexits(3)
manpage](http://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=3&topic=sysexits).

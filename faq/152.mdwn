[[!meta title="What language should I write my program in?"]]
We recommend that [Python](http://python.org/) be used for new code,
since it is a popular choice beyond MIT, much of the scripts.mit.edu
team uses it, and any future maintainers of are relatively likely to
know it (as MIT teaches many classes in Python). Popular Python
frameworks include [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and
[flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) with
[sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

[PHP](http://www.php.net/) is probably the mostly commonly used language
on scripts.mit.edu (WordPress and Mediawiki are written in it).

A [wide variety of other
languages](/faq/16/what-programming-languages-are-supported) also work,
including [Ruby on
Rails](/faq/53/does-scriptsmitedu-support-ruby-on-rails).

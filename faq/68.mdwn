[[!meta title="How do I reset my password for MediaWiki?"]]
The easiest way to avoid this problem is to set an e-mail address in
your account, so you can use the “Mail me a new password” feature.
However, if you find that you’ve forgotten the password to an account on
your wiki, and you don’t have an e-mail address set for it, you can
reset its password as follows:

Log in to [phpMyAdmin](http://sql.mit.edu/phpMyAdmin/) with your [SQL
password.](/faq/59/)

From the menu on the left, select the database corresponding to your
wiki, and select the “user” table within it.

Click “Browse” at the top, and note down the user ID for the account
whose password you want to reset. (This will be 1 for the first
account.)

Click “SQL” at the top, and run the following command, replacing “uid”
with the user ID and “newpassword” with the new password for the
account:

-   UPDATE user SET user\_password = MD5(CONCAT(user\_id, ‘-’,
    MD5(’*newpassword*‘))) WHERE user\_id = *uid*

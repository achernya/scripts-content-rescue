[[!meta title="How do I enable file uploads to my MediaWiki?"]]
To enable uploads, edit the LocalSettings.php file in your MediaWiki
install directory, and change the line reading
`$wgEnableUploads = false;` to `$wgEnableUploads = true;`.

MediaWiki by default allows uploads of images with the following
extensions: png, gif, jpg, and jpeg. To upload more file types, you will
also need to add lines such as

    $wgFileExtensions[] = 'doc';
    $wgFileExtensions[] = 'pdf';

for each extension (.doc and .pdf in this example) you would like to
allow your site to upload. You can add these lines anywhere after the
line starting with **require\_once** and before the **?\>** at the end
of the file.

Certain file types, such as .zip, cannot be properly uploaded with the
default file-type detection system. If you have problems uploading
certain file types, you may need to use an additional file-type
detector, named “file”, with this command:

    $wgMimeDetectorCommand = 'file -bi';

If you run into trouble, please check the [MediaWiki web
site](http://www.mediawiki.org/) or contact
[scripts@mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu/scripts@mit.edu).

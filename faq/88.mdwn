[[!meta title="How do I move my MediaWiki to a new locker?"]]
Unfortunately, it is a multi-step process to move a MediaWiki
installation to a new locker.

To move a MediaWiki located in directory `/mit/A/web_scripts/index` to a
new directory `/mit/B/web_scripts/index`:

​1. Attach the two directories so as to make administrative tasks
easier:\
 `athena% attach A`\
 `athena% attach B`

​2. To sign up the second locker (if necessary)\
 `athena% add scripts`\
 `athena% signup-web B`

​3. Copy the Databases using SQL.\
 3b) While in Locker B signup for sql\
 `athena% signup-sql`\
 3c) Sign into phpMyAdmin web interface at http://sql.mit.edu/\
 3d) You will need the username and password located in the .my.cnf file
of each locker (i.e. `/mit/A/.my.cnf`).\
 3e) Sign into the SQL account for locker A using phpMyAdmin first.\
 3f) Click on A+index\
 3g) Use the export button to download a copy of the database to your
computer.\
 3h) Exit and Sign into the SQL account for locker B (NOT phpMyAdmin)\
 3i) Create a new database using the “add” field in the bottom right of
the list of databases.\
 3j) Sign into phpMyAdmin for locker B\
 3k) Click on B+index\
 3l) Use the import tool to import the file you just exported from your
\
 desktop. Be sure to select the correct character set.

​4. Recursively copy the software,\
 `athena% cp -r /mit/A/web_scripts/index /mit/B/web_scripts`

​5. Update settings:\
 5a) Update the `/mit/B/web_scripts/index/LocalSettings.php` with the
wgSitename,\
 wgScriptPath, wgDBname, wgDBuser, and wbDBpassword lines to reflect\
 the new locker

5b) Update the `/mit/B/web_scripts/index/php.ini` file with the correct
locker username for the\
 upload\_tmp\_dir and the session.save\_path (otherwise the computer
will not\
 remember that you are logged in)

​6) Be happy.

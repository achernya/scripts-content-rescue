[[!meta title="Can I use scripts.mit.edu to generate an Apache-style log file for my web.mit.edu site?"]]
Yes. The combination of Server Side Includes on `web.mit.edu`, a Perl
script, and the SIPB web script service allows you to get a log file
similar to the data you would be able to get if you were hosting the web
pages on your own server.

How to set it up:

​1. [Sign up to use scripts.mit.edu](/web). \
 2. Save the
[fake\_log.pl](http://web.mit.edu/scripts/www/fake_log.pl.txt) script
into your `~/web_scripts` directory with a name that ends in `.pl`.\
 3. Make sure your web pages have the extension `.shtml`, and insert the
following code into your web pages, replacing `USERNAME` with your
username (and, if you called `fake_log.pl` something else, use the name
that you chose):

    <!-- Generate data that looks like an Apache log -->
    <img src="http://scripts.mit.edu/~USERNAME/fake_log.pl?uri=
    <!--#echo var="DOCUMENT_URI" -->&amp;ref=
    <!--#echo var="HTTP_REFERER" -->&amp;met=
    <!--#echo var="REQUEST_METHOD" -->&amp;pro=
    <!--#echo var="SERVER_PROTOCOL" -->" 
    width="1" height="1" alt="fake image for tracking"/>

​4. The `fake_log.pl` script logs each hit to a file called `fake.log`
in your `~/web_scripts` directory. This log is designed to be compatible
with Apache log files, so that you can use any of the myriad tools for
analyzing and visualizing data from Apache log files.

Some questions and answers:

**How does this work?**

The `fake_log.pl` script works by taking the data returned from several
Server Side Includes that work on `web.mit.edu` and using that and other
data to write out an entry with the same format that Apache uses.

**Since you’re just feeding information into a Perl script instead of
getting the real server logs, couldn’t someone feed the Perl script
garbage, or misleading information?**

Yes. Invalid information will probably make the Perl script just plain
fail. This method of logging data does not prevent people from
deliberately feeding you bad data, but in most cases, no one will care
to take the time to do so.

**Will this log hits from text-only browsers?**\
 Since this tracking method relies on the browser loading images, this
will not log hits from text-only browsers.

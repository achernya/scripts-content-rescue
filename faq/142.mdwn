[[!meta title="How do I do certificate authentication with Django?"]]
Using certificate authentication with Django probably requires
configuring another authentication backend. SIPBâ€™s snippets collection
has [code](http://web.mit.edu/snippets/django/mit/) and [limited
documentation](http://web.mit.edu/snippets/django/README.md) on how to
do this. If you have issues with those instructions, please let us know.

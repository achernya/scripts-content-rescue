[[!meta title="Why isn't my symlink working?"]]
Although you can use symlinks underneath your web\_scripts directory to
point to other files to point to other files underneath your
web\_scripts directory, you cannot use symlinks to point to executables
outside of your web\_scripts directory (for example, you cannot point at
executables in another Athena locker). scripts.mit.edu expects all of
your web scripts to reside underneath your web\_scripts directory.

[[!meta title="How can I access my MySQL databases?"]]
First youâ€™ll need to [sign up for sql.mit.edu](/faq/66).

After that, you must use the [sql.mit.edu web
interface](http://sql.mit.edu/) to **create and drop databases**. A
regular MySQL client, such as
[phpMyAdmin](http://scripts.mit.edu/~sql/phpMyAdmin/) (described below),
cannot be used for these operations.

**All other SQL commands** can be issued from any host, client, and/or
script of your choice; simply connect to the MySQL server at
`sql.mit.edu` using your new MySQL username and password. You can also
access your databases using an online web interface called
[phpMyAdmin](http://scripts.mit.edu/~sql/phpMyAdmin/).

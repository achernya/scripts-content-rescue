[[!meta title="Can I add a vhost before I point my domain at scripts?"]]
The easiest approach is simply to [point the domain at
scripts](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/14/do-cnames-work-with-the-script-service)
*before* you set it up, but if you wish to migrate a currently active
website, you may want to have the vhost set up on scripts before
changing the DNS to avoid interruption.

If you want to do this, scripts will require that you create a file in
the root directory of your existing website. For instance, if you are
trying to add the domain “example.com” and it asks for the file
“scripts\_870shdfs8.html”, you should make sure that
http://example.com/scripts\_870shdfs8.html exists (though its content is
irrelevant).

If you want to use a wildcard (e.g. \*.example.com), you should make
sure that *all* subdomains matching the wildcard point to the same
place, and contain the file listed – for instance, for \*.example.com,
a.example.com, b.example.com and c.example.com should all contain the
file.

[[!meta title="I'm seeing: "It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings.""]]
If you are getting the PHP warning:

> **Warning**: date() [function.date]: It is not safe to rely on the
> system’s timezone settings. You are \\\*required\\\* to use the
> date.timezone setting or the date\_default\_timezone\_set() function.
> In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this
> warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We
> selected ‘America/New\_York’ for ‘EDT/-4.0/DST’ instead in
> /afs/athena.mit.edu/… on line 0

You can resolve it by editing or creating a php.ini file in the same
directory as the PHP script emitting this error and adding the line:

    date.timezone = America/New_York

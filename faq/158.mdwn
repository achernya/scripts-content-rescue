[[!meta title="Why shouldn't I use scripts.mit.edu/~locker URLs?"]]
Early versions of the scripts.mit.edu webhosting platform used URLs of
the form http://scripts.mit.edu/\~locker/ (or
http://scripts-cert.mit.edu/\~locker/). Those URLs still work, but have
long since been deprecated in favor of URLs like
http://locker.scripts.mit.edu/. Current autoinstallers and documentation
all use the new form of the URLs (if you find exceptions, please
[contact us](mailto:scripts@mit.edu)).

The older \~ form of URLs, in addition to being aesthetically
unpleasing, is incompatible with the modern web’s security model. Under
the “same-origin policy”, browsers consider a site at
https://scripts.mit.edu/\~locker/ to be run by the same group as one at
https://scripts.mit.edu/\~evil/, and allow JavaScript from the latter to
interfere with the former. (You can read more at
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) or the
[Mozilla Developer
Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).)
As a result, using \~ URLs is discouraged and will stop working entirely
at some point in the future.

[[!meta title="Can I authenticate people using MIT personal certificates?"]]
Yes. There are two ways to do so: one will limit access to an entire
directory (with an .htaccess file), and the second will provide the
information in the [MIT personal certificate](http://ca.mit.edu) to your
scripts.

#### Limiting access with .htaccess

Create a plain-text file called .htaccess in the directory to which you
want to restrict access (for example, in the base directory of your wiki
or other piece of software).

-   To allow anybody with an MIT certificate to access your site (i.e.,
    to make your site MIT-only), add the following lines to the
    .htaccess file:
    -   **`AuthType SSLCert Require valid-user ErrorDocument 401 /__scripts/needcerts`**

-   To restrict access to a particular set of one or more usernames:
    -   **`AuthType SSLCert Require user username1 username2 ErrorDocument 401 /__scripts/needcerts`**

-   To restrict access to members of a Moira list (aka traditional or
    blanche list) that is an *AFS* group:
    -   `AuthType SSLCert Require afsgroup system:group1 system:group2 ErrorDocument 401 /__scripts/needcerts`

-   If you want to allow access to members of *either* an existing list
    or a list of usernames, you’ll need to [create a new
    list](http://wserv.mit.edu/lc) containing the existing list and any
    additional usernames.

(The **ErrorDocument 401 /\_\_scripts/needcerts** line ensures that
users are redirected to an HTTPS connection on port 444, which is
configured to accept certificates. If the user has no certificates, they
will be presented with a default error page; to use a custom error page,
you can instead use **ErrorDocument 401
/\_\_scripts/needcerts/\~username/customerror.cgi**.)

Note that the list in question must be visible and an AFS group. You can
check the status by running **blanche *group* -i** at an Athena prompt:
it should say “visible” under flags and “is a group” on the next line.
(If you own the list, you can change these by running **blanche *group*
-V** to make it visible and **blanche *group* -G** to make it an AFS
group.)

Please double-check that the restrictions are enforced properly, e.g.,
by using a computer that doesn’t have certificates or asking someone
else to try accessing the page. Note that scripts does **not** support
**.htaccess.mit** files.

If you have any questions about using this system for restricting
access, please contact [scripts@mit.edu](mailto:scripts@mit.edu).

#### Finding certificate information from CGI scripts

If you access your website with HTTPS on port 444
(**https://username.scripts.mit.edu:444/**), the scripts server will
request a certificate from the user. It will then create special [SSL
environment
variables](http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_reference.html#ToC25)
based on the user’s identity. The most useful is the variable
SSL\_CLIENT\_S\_DN\_Email, which can be used to determine the Athena
username of the individual currently accessing your script.

Here’s an example of listing these environment variables with Perl:\
 [code](http://web.mit.edu/~jbarnold/web_scripts/demo/env.pl.html) |
[output without SSL](http://scripts.mit.edu/~jbarnold/demo/env.pl) |
[output with SSL](https://scripts-cert.mit.edu/~jbarnold/demo/env.pl)

Here’s another example, using PHP to detect whether you’re using
certificates:\
 [code](http://web.mit.edu/~geofft/web_scripts/detect.php) | [output
without SSL](http://scripts.mit.edu/~geofft/demo/detect.php) | [output
with SSL](https://scripts-cert.mit.edu/~geofft/demo/detect.php)

If you’re using Django, a certificate authentication backend is
available:\

You can also limit access using
[passwords](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/23/).

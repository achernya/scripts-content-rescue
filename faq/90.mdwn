[[!meta title="How do I access the Authorization headers from a FastCGI?"]]
Apache by default does not pass the Authorization header through to
FastCGI scripts. If you want access to it (perhaps for use with Ruby on
Rails), you need to add the following to a .htaccess file:

    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.+)
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1 [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1,PT]

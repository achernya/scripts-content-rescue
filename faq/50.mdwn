[[!meta title="What file extensions are served directly to the web using my scripts.mit.edu account?"]]
When a file with one of the following extensions 1) is underneath your
web\_scripts directory and 2) is not protected by a .htaccess file, it
will be served directly to the web using your scripts.mit.edu account
(you may want to read [this description](/faq/48/) of what files your
account can access). In other words, you do not need to make files with
the following extensions world-readable in order for them to be served
directly to the web:

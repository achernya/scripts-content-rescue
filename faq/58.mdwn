[[!meta title="Who is a locker administrator?"]]
For technical reasons (part of the signup process involves giving the
scripts server access to the web\_scripts directory) as well as
practical ones (only authorized users should be able to act on behalf of
the locker), we require that anyone who is setting up scripts services
for a locker be a locker administrator.

You can view the locker administrators with the command **fs la**
(filesystem list access), e.g.:

athena% **attach scripts**\
 athena% **fs la /mit/scripts**\
 Access list for /mit/scripts is\
 Normal rights:\
   system:scripts-root rlidwka\
   system:anyuser rl

Any entry with lowercase “a” at the end indicates a locker
administrator. If the entry starts with “system:”, it refers to a Moira
list; otherwise, it is a username. (The notable exceptions are
system:anyuser, which refers to the public, and system:administrators,
which includes only IS&T staff.) You can usually find out the members of
a list with the command **blanche**, e.g., **blanche scripts-root** or
using [WebMoira](https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/). (Generally, you can
also just e-mail the list.)

In general, we recommend maintaining a list (which must be marked as an
“AFS group”) that has admininstrative access, rather than individually
granting access to users. A list owner can use **blanche** or WebMoira
([https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/listname](https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/listname))
to update the membership of lists.

Any existing locker administrator can make you directly or a list
containing you an administrator using the **fs sa** (filesystem set
access) command:

athena% **attach** *locker*\
 athena% **fs sa /mit/**locker system:*listname* **all**

(Or:\
 athena% **fs sa /mit/**locker *username* **all**\
 to grant access directly to a user.)

If you are unable to contact any locker administrators, you should have
someone appropriate (e.g., an officer of the student group), which may
be you, e-mail [accounts@mit.edu](mailto:accounts@mit.edu).

[[!meta title="Can I limit access to my scripts and/or other content using passwords?"]]
Yes. Follow these instructions to limit web access to a subdirectory of
your web\_scripts directory:

​1. Decide upon one or more usernames and passwords that will be allowed
to access the content. Do not use your Athena password!\
 2. On Athena, cd to the directory to which you want to limit access.\
 3. Run “add scripts”.\
 4. Run “webaccess allow USER\_NAME” and enter the desired password for
USER\_NAME upon request.\
 5. Repeat step \#4 for every username that you want to be able to
access the content.\
 6. Use a web browser to confirm that access is being restricted
correctly.

“webaccess remove USER\_NAME” will remove a user’s access.\
 “webaccess reset” will clear all access restrictions on a directory.

(webaccess works by creating .htaccess and .htpasswd files for you)

You can also limit access using [MIT
certificates](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/15/).

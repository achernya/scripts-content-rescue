[[!meta title="Why is ssh -k recommended for ssh-ing into scripts.mit.edu?"]]
Kerberos ticket forwarding (ssh -K [note the capital letter], the
default on Athena) will attempt to transfer your full Athena credentials
to scripts.mit.edu. The scripts server does not need these credentials,
and good security practice suggests that you should not transfer your
credentials where you do not need them.

If you instead use ssh -k [note the lower case letter], you will
authenticate yourself to the scripts server using your kerberos tickets,
without giving the scripts server any special priveleges over your
Athena account.

In short, **ssh -k scripts.mit.edu** is the recommended means of ssh-ing
to the scripts server.

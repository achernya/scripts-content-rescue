[[!meta title="Do you enforce any resource limits?"]]
Yes. The server enforces the following resource limits on web scripts:\

    core file size          (blocks) 0
    data seg size           (kbytes) 1048576
    file size               (blocks) unlimited
    pending signals                  32255
    max locked memory       (kbytes) 32
    max memory size         (kbytes) 524268
    open files                       1024
    pipe size            (512 bytes) 8
    POSIX message queues     (bytes) 819200
    stack size              (kbytes) 10240
    cpu time               (seconds) 300
    max user processes               4096
    virtual memory          (kbytes) 524288
    file locks                       unlimited

These limits exist primarily to protect the server from runaway scripts.

There are also some timeouts in the Apache configuration that apply to
web scripts. In particular, if a CGI or FastCGI application goes 30
seconds without writing and flushing any data back to Apache, the
request will be aborted.

Finally, there are also looser limits placed on processes launched from
a non-web context:\

    core file size          (blocks) 0
    data seg size           (kbytes) 1048576
    file size               (blocks) unlimited
    pending signals                  32255
    max locked memory       (kbytes) 32
    max memory size         (kbytes) 524268
    open files                       1024
    pipe size            (512 bytes) 8
    POSIX message queues     (bytes) 819200
    stack size              (kbytes) 10240
    cpu time               (seconds) unlimited
    max user processes               1024
    virtual memory          (kbytes) 1048576
    file locks                       unlimited

If you find yourself running into these limits on a regular basis,
please contact us to let us know what is triggering the limits.

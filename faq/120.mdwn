[[!meta title="Does scripts.mit.edu publish information about who runs which websites?"]]
We don’t go out of our way to make this information available, nor to \
 protect it.

There is no listing of websites hosted on scripts.mit.edu or their \
 maintainers. If we’re asked to by IS&T staff (e.g., IT Security or User
\
 Accounts) or law enforcement, we will identify the maintainer of a
single \
 website. We may also do so if needed in the process of answering a \
 good-faith support ticket about the maintenance of that website. \
 Otherwise, we avoid giving this information out to the public for the \
 asking.

That said, for multiple technical reasons ranging from the configuration
\
 of our servers to the properties of various parts of Athena
infrastructure \
 we build upon, it’s generally possible to determine the ownership of a
\
 website with some concerted effort, including which users or groups
have \
 the ability to publish the site and who was the original creator of a
file \
 in a locker. Most of this is due to the Athena locker model itself, and
\
 applies equally to sites hosted on other services such as web.mit.edu.

Most other MIT hosting options will also reveal the owner’s identity \
 publicly through Moira’s hostname registry. If you wish to have a truly
\
 anonymous website, you’ll need to get hosting independent of the MIT \
 infrastructure.

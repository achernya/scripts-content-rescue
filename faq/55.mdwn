[[!meta title="How do I enable math support in my MediaWiki wiki?"]]
Here is the procedure for enabling math support for a scripts.mit.edu
wiki:

​1) [ssh to scripts.mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/41/)

​2) cd to your wiki’s math directory and run **make**

​3) Edit the LocalSettings.php file in the base directory of your wiki
so that the line

**\$wgUseTeX = false;**

reads

**\$wgUseTeX = true;**

You will then need to re-save any existing pages that contain equations
in order to have the equations appear correctly.

If you encounter trouble with this procedure, please contact
scripts@mit.edu.

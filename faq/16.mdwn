[[!meta title="Is language "foo" or software package "bar" installed?"]]
If you’d like to check whether the service has certain software
installed, you can [ssh to scripts.mit.edu](/faq/41) from an Athena
computer (you must first have signed up for one of the script services).

The service supports essentially any programming language with a Linux
implementation. If you want to use a language (or language version) that
is not installed on the server, you can either contact us at
scripts@mit.edu (we might be able to install what you want) or you can
use a [shebang line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29)
(and provide your own binary in AFS). Since the server is running Linux,
custom shebang lines must point to Linux-compatible executables.

Here’s a shebang line demo:

We also have instructions for [installing Python libraries into your
locker](/faq/126/) and a [more detailed FAQ about Java](/faq/151).

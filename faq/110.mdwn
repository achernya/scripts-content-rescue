[[!meta title="What are the names of the various scripts.mit.edu servers?"]]
scripts.mit.edu makes use of load balancing across several different
servers to handle the enormous number of requests that are served each
day. It is very important that you ***not*** hardcode the names of the
servers into your scripts, because different servers may be in the load
balancer pool at any given time.

You can find out the current list of active servers by visiting this URL
at any time:\
 [http://scripts.mit.edu/servers](http://scripts.mit.edu/servers)

You may also obtain this information via finger:

    athena% finger @scripts.mit.edu

The section of the finger output that corresponds to balancing of web
requests to ports 80, 443, and 444 is the part under the heading:\
 `FWM 2 wlc persistent 600`

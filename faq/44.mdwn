[[!meta title="What are scripts.mit.edu security updates?"]]
If you use the scripts.mit.edu [automatic installers](/start), the
software that you install will be set up so that it can receive
automatic security updates from the scripts.mit.edu maintainers. If you
plan to manage security updates for your software on your own, you
should remove **system:scripts-security-upd** from the AFS ACLs of the
directories of your automatically-installed software.

(We will attempt to deal with security problems in the
automatically-installed software, but we cannot realistically make
meaningful guarantees about security, as we are
[volunteer-run](/faq/136/).).

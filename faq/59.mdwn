[[!meta title="What is .my.cnf? What is my sql.mit.edu password?"]]
Your sql.mit.edu login information is in your locker, in the file
“.my.cnf”. This is a hidden file (dotfile), so you will need to use **ls
-a** instead of **ls** to see it. You can still view and edit the file
just by specifying the filename.

athena% **cd /mit/***locker*\
 athena% **cat .my.cnf**\
 [mysql]\
 host=sql.mit.edu\
 user=*username*\
 password=*password*

This file should be a link to “.sql/my.cnf” in your locker, and only
accessible by the locker owner and the scripts server (regardless of
whether the root of the locker is publicly readable or not).

If you update your MySQL password on the [MIT SIPB MySQL
interface](http://sql.mit.edu/), you will need to update this file
manually with your new MySQL password. Otherwise, the [scripts
auto-installers](/start), as well as the **mysql** command-line client,
will not be able to log in properly. If you have already installed
software, you will need to update the password there too
(LocalSettings.php for MediaWiki, wp-config.php for WordPress, etc.)

If you have lost your MySQL password and, it’s not in your .my.cnf file,
you can reset it for your personal account by logging into
[sql.mit.edu](http://sql.mit.edu/) with your MIT certificate. If you
have lost the password for a group locker, please e-mail
[sql@mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu/sql.mit.edu) for help getting it
reset.

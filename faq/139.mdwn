[[!meta title="Can I make changes to autoinstalled code and still receive security updates?"]]
The scripts.mit.edu project provides [autoinstallers](/start/) for many
common web applications. As with any other application you run on the
scripts.mit.edu platform, you can freely make changes.

However, changes can present a potential issue for our [security
updates](/faq/44).\
 Sometimes, our updater can merge changes you make with the changes
needed to update to the next version. However, sometimes your changes
will conflict with changes in the new version. When that happens,
sometimes the scripts.mit.edu team will merge the changes by hand, but
in some cases you may need to do the upgrade yourself.

It is also possible that changes might be subtly incompatible, breaking
your site. While we do some basic testing on updates, we do not
guarantee success.

If you are particularly concerned about these issues, you should either
[opt-out of updates](/faq/44) or not make changes to autoinstalled
application code.

[[!meta title="Can my scripts write data somewhere?"]]
You can give your scripts permission to write data to subdirectories of
your Athena home directory by granting appropriate AFS access to
**daemon.scripts** (we provide sample commands below).

Each scripts.mit.edu user can also write up to 10MB (or 10k inodes) to
/tmp. You should only write truly temporary data to /tmp.

Here are some commands that might be helpful:

The following command will grant the script server write access to\
 your current directory (cd into the directory that you want to write to
and\
 then run this command):\

    fs sa . daemon.scripts write

The following command will grant the script server write access to all
subdirectories of your current directory (you could cd into a particular
directory and then run this command in order to grant the script server
write access to all subdirectories of that directory):\

    athrun scripts fssar daemon.scripts write

The following command will list the access control list for the current
directory:\

    fs la .

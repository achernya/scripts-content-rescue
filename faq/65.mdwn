[[!meta title="WordPress becomes inaccessible after changing settings"]]
This is probably because WordPress tried to create an `.htaccess` file,
and `.htaccess` files need [special
treatment](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/47/) to work with the scripts
server. Follow [these instructions](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/48/) to
mark the `.htaccess` file as accessible to the Apache web server.

We expect this problem to be corrected in a future update to our
WordPress autoinstaller.

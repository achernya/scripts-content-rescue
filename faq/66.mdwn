[[!meta title="How can I signup my personal or group locker for the MySQL service?"]]
If your group does not already have a locker, start by mailing
[accounts@mit.edu](http://web.mit.edu/accounts) to get one.

**Please note**: MySQL has hard-coded a 16 character limit for usernames
into its server and client. Since all MySQL accounts are linked to
Athena lockers by name, *your locker must be no more than 16 characters
to use the sql.mit.edu service*.

Individuals or groups that have lockers can easily register for a MySQL
account at an Athena prompt:

`athena$ add scripts`\
 `athena$ signup-sql`

Individuals wishing to register an account for themselves should select
**option \#1** at the first prompt. To register an account for a group,
select **option \#2** at the first prompt.

You can then read your password from
[/mit/*locker*/.sql/my.cnf](/faq/59). You can use this to log in to
[sql.mit.edu](http://sql.mit.edu) under the “SQL Password” option. You
will need to create and drop databases from sql.mit.edu, but you can do
all other operations from any MySQL client. We recommend using
[phpMyAdmin](http://sql.mit.edu/phpMyAdmin/).

[[!meta title="How can I set a custom error page on Scripts?"]]
If you want to make Scripts use a customized error page for a 404 (File
Not Found) error, you need to place the following lines in your
**.htaccess** file:

**\
 ErrorDocument 404 /\~lockername/404.html\
**

Remember to replace **lockername** with the name of your locker, and
**404.html** with the location of the customized error page.

If you have additional error pages, create an additional line for each
error code. Typical error codes include 401 (Unauthorized) and 403
(Forbidden).

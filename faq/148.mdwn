[[!meta title="How can I install Ruby gems in my locker?"]]
First, note that many Ruby gems are already installed on
scripts.mit.edu, and we’re generally pretty willing to install
generally-useful software globally; email us at scripts@mit.edu to ask.
This has the advantage that you won’t have to worry about keeping the
packages up to date; in some cases, using out-of-date modules could lead
to security vulnerabilities in your site. Furthermore, a frequent
practice in the Ruby community is to have sets of Ruby packages
associated with deployments, in which case installing a gem in your
locker might be too global.

In order to install a Ruby gem to your locker, you will first need to
create the directory to install into and give scripts.mit.edu permission
to it. From an Athena prompt, do the following, where lockername is the
name of your locker:

    add consult
    mkdir /mit/lockername/.gem
    mkdir /mit/lockername/.bundle
    mkdir /mit/lockername/bin
    fsr sa /mit/lockername/.gem daemon.scripts write
    fsr sa /mit/lockername/.bundle daemon.scripts write
    fsr sa /mit/lockername/bin daemon.scripts write

To tell a bundler configured app to use this local Gem store, run this
command on a Scripts server, in the directory of your application:

    bundle config path ~/.gem/ruby/1.9.1

Then, to install a gem, SSH into Scripts and run:

    gem install -l gemname

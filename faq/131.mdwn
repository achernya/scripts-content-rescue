[[!meta title="How do I use ASP.Net Applications on Scripts?"]]
We do not recommend using ASP.NET on scripts.mit.edu, as few if any
scripts team members and scripts-hosted sites use it, making it likely
to break during server changes, and making you less likely to receive
help with issues. We have a [list of some recommended
languages](/faq/152/what-language-should-i-write-my-program-in) that you
can look over instead.

That said, you may be able to get ASP.Net applications to work on
Scripts with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page).\
 To try, add the following to your `.htaccess` file:

    DirectoryIndex index.aspx
    Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
    SetEnv MONO_SHARED_DIR "/tmp/$USERNAME"
    AddHandler fcgid-script .asax .ashx .asmx .aspx .axd .config .cs .dll .rem .soap

    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .asax
    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .ashx
    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .asmx
    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .aspx
    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .ascx
    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .axd
    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .config
    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .cs
    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .dll
    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .rem
    FCGIWrapper "/usr/bin/fastcgi-mono-server2 /applications=/test:/mit/pweaver/web_scripts/test" .soap

Replace /test:/mit/pweaver/web\_scripts/test with the applicationâ€™s name
and path of you application in your web\_scripts directory.

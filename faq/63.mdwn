[[!meta title="Can I set up my scripts site to forward/redirect to another website?"]]
Yes. If you would like to redirect all web requests for a given URL on
scripts.mit.edu to another website (such as web.mit.edu), follow these
instructions:

**Note:** These directions are only appropriate for redirecting a URL on
your scripts.mit.edu site to another URL that is **not** also on your
scripts site. If you want to, for example, cause
http://mylocker.scripts.mit.edu to take people to
http://mylocker.scripts.mit.edu/wiki, please skip to the directions at
the end of the page.

​1. Create a directory for the redirect. In these examples, we will be
redirecting http://mygroup.scripts.mit.edu/subpage/ to
http://www.example.com/other/website/, so create the “subpage”
directory:\
 athena% **attach**mygroup\
 athena% **mkdir /mit/**mygroup**/web\_scripts/**subpage

​2. Create a text file named .htaccess within your the new directory,
e.g.:\
 athena% **cd /mit/**mygroup**/web\_scripts/**subpage\
 athena% **emacs .htaccess**

​3. Place two lines like the following in the .htaccess file:\
 **RedirectPermanent /\~**mygroup**/**subpage**/**
http://www.example.com/other/site/\
 **RedirectPermanent /**subpage**/** http://www.example.com/other/site/\
 This will send requests to either
http://scripts.mit.edu/\~mygroup/subpage/ or
http://mygroup.scripts.mit.edu/subpage/ to the right address. It will
also redirect, e.g., http://mygroup.scripts.mit.edu/subpage/foo.html to
http://www.example.com/other/site/subpage/foo.html.

If you would like the redirect not to be cached by web browsers (e.g.,if
you’re planning to change the redirect or set up a scripts site at this
address), use “RedirectTemp” instead of “RedirectPermanent.”

If you’re also planning to get a [mygroup.mit.edu-style
address](/faq/14/) (a CNAME) to redirect to an outside site, then add at
the bottom\
 **RedirectPermanent /** http://www.example.com/other/site/

If, instead of redirecting visitors to a different website, you wish to
cause visitors who go to http://mylocker.scripts.mit.edu to be
redirected to http://mylocker.scripts.mit.edu/wiki (or something
similar), you can do the following:

​1. Create a text file named .htaccess in your locker’s web\_scripts
directory (or edit an existing one), e.g.:\
 athena% **cd /mit/**mylocker**/web\_scripts**\
 athena% **emacs .htaccess**

​2. Place a line like the following near the top of the .htaccess file:\
 **RedirectMatch \^/?\$** /wiki\
 This will only send requests to http://mylocker.scripts.mit.edu to the
initial address for the wiki. It will not interfere with the way the
rest of your existing URLs work.

More information about redirect rules is available in the [Apache
documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_alias.html#redirect).

You can also [set up your web.mit.edu or www.mit.edu site to forward to
scripts](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/54).

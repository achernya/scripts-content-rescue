[[!meta title="Can my group use scripts.mit.edu or sql.mit.edu with our Athena locker?"]]
Yes! All scripts.mit.edu services support both groups and individual
users. Any [administrator of your Athena locker](/faq/58) can act on
behalf of your group. The [quick-start installer system](/start) may be
a good way of getting started.

If you need to ssh to scripts.mit.edu in order to run commands on behalf
of a group locker, you should do so using the special instructions
provided on our [ssh documentation page](/faq/41/).

You can sign up for sql.mit.edu by [following our
instructions](/faq/66/how-do-i-signup-my-grouplocker-with-the-mysql-service).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact
[scripts@mit.edu](mailto:scripts@mit.edu).

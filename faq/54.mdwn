[[!meta title="How do I redirect visitors from my web.mit.edu or www.mit.edu URL to my scripts.mit.edu website?"]]
URLs on web.mit.edu (e.g., http://web.mit.edu/jbarnold/ or
http://web.mit.edu/\~jbarnold/, the tilde is optional) point to the top
level of your Athena locker (/mit/jbarnold in this case).

URLs on www.mit.edu (e.g., http://www.mit.edu/\~jbarnold/, the tilde is
required) point to the www subdirectory of your Athena locker
(/mit/jbarnold/www).

If you want visitors to your web.mit.edu or www.mit.edu URL to see your
scripts site instead, first, cd to the directory corresponding to your
web.mit.edu or www.mit.edu URL (for example, my directory
/mit/jbarnold/www corresponds to the URL http://www.mit.edu/\~jbarnold):

athena% **attach jbarnold**\
 athena% **cd /mit/jbarnold/www**

Next, create a **.htaccess.mit** file in this directory and add rewrite
rules to it. For example, if I wanted to redirect both
**http://www.mit.edu/\~jbarnold/** and
**http://web.mit.edu/jbarnold/www** to
**http://jbarnold.scripts.mit.edu**, I would add the following two
lines:

**Redirect 301 /\~jbarnold http://jbarnold.scripts.mit.edu**\
 **Redirect 301 /jbarnold/www http://jbarnold.scripts.mit.edu**

The first line handles redirecting http://www.mit.edu/\~jbarnold to
http://jbarnold.scripts.mit.edu and the second line (which is completely
independent) handles redirecting http://web.mit.edu/\~jbarnold to
http://jbarnold.scripts.mit.edu.

Finally, if you placed this in your locker, rather in the www
subdirectory, you may need to give the web.mit.edu server access to your
locker, so it can read your .htaccess.mit file (warning: this will also
cause all the files in your locker to be readable over web.mit.edu):

athena% **fs sa . system:htaccess.mit read**

You should check that the redirect is working, and that people cannot
read your personal files via web.mit.edu (e.g.,
http://web.mit.edu/jbarnold/).

You can find more information about .htaccess files and Apache Redirect
rules via Google. IS&T has a [website about .htaccess.mit
files](http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/display/istcontrib/Web+Publishing+-+Access+privileges+on+web.mit.edu),
but it focuses on restricting content, not redirects. If you have
questions about how you should set up your .htaccess.mit file, feel free
to contact us by e-mailing scripts@mit.edu.

You can also [redirect visitors from your scripts.mit.edu site to
another website](http://scripts.mit.edu/faq/63).

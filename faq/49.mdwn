[[!meta title="Why does reading files cause 'permission denied' errors on scripts.mit.edu?"]]
If you get this error when ssh’d to scripts and trying to access another
locker, please make sure you’ve followed the [directions to ssh to
scripts](/faq/41/). If you are getting this error when running scripts,
or when accessing files under the locker you’re logged in as, please
continue reading.

On scripts.mit.edu, your scripts are served using special Athena
filesystem privileges associated with your account on scripts.mit.edu.
These privileges allow your scripts.mit.edu account to access any file
that is **both** 1) inside your AFS locker and 2) accessible by
“daemon.scripts” (a special set of AFS credentials owned by the script
server).

The signup process takes care of setting up your web\_scripts directory
so that daemon.scripts has access to your web\_scripts directory and its
subdirectories. To give daemon.scripts read access to other parts of
your home directory, you can do, for example:

    athena% add consult
    athena% fsr sa ~/my-scripts-data/ daemon.scripts read

Certain kinds of “non-executable content” (for example, images)
underneath your web\_scripts directory are also served to the web using
your scripts.mit.edu credentials. Here is [the complete list](/faq/50)
of the file extensions served directly to the web using your
scripts.mit.edu account.

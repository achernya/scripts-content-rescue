[[!meta title="The server is down, what do I do?"]]
Although this service has been designed with reliability in mind, the
SIPB MySQL service should not be used to host critical applications that
cannot tolerate downtime. We perform no query logging, schema or data
backups, or any other backups otherwise generally available. You are
solely responsible for performing backups of your data. We maintain
general usage statistics of this service by the MIT community at large.

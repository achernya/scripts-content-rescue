[[!meta title="How can I make Dreamweaver work with my MySQL databases?"]]
Dreamweaver’s MySQL interface interprets a “+” character as a space, so
when looking for database “USERNAME+DBNAME” it looks for “USERNAME
DBNAME”.

CGI scripts on the web have a long history of using + as a substitute
for space.

To prevent Dreamweaver from doing this, percent-encode the “+” sign as
“%2B”. Ask it to use a database name like:

-   USERNAME%2BDBNAME

for example,

-   presbrey%2Bwiki

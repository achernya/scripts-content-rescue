Yes. If you have a valid reason for getting a subdomain of mit.edu,
please fill out the following form. You will need MIT certificates. Note
that hostnames can only contain letters (case-insensitive), numbers, and
hyphens, and you must select a valid, existing directory on scripts.

\
 New name: .mit.edu

(hostname).mit.edu points to: scripts.mit.edu/\~

Redirect standard (http://) requests to a secure connection (https://)\
 Require MIT certificates when accessing via https://

\

Your request will be sent to the scripts team, and you should receive a
reply within a day or two if your request is accepted. (All reasonable
requests will be accepted if the name is available.) The URL will start
working in a few more days, after IS&T updates the DNS servers to have
the new subdomain.

Please note that you cannot request a name that is already taken by
someone else: you can use SIPB’s [machine lookup
form](http://stuff.mit.edu/machine) to check if the name is taken. If
the name is owned by you, we will contact you to make sure you want to
move the name to scripts.mit.edu and find out what new name you want to
give the existing IP address.

If you are unable to use this form (e.g., you don’t have certificates,
or you want to point your own domain name at scripts), please e-mail
[scripts@mit.edu](mailto:scripts@mit.edu).
